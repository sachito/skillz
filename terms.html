  <h1>Terms</h1>
 <p>Last modified October 5th, 2016

Welcome to Skillz, a service offered by Intelligence+ (. ("Skillz", "Skillz.io", “Intelligence+”, “IPlus”, “we”, “us” or “our”).

Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of our Site and our online 
service accessible via our Site and bot (“Bot”). We provide the services to individuals associated with (e.g., as an employee of) 
a customer of Intelligence+. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services and Bot are collectively called the 
“Services.”</p>



<h2>1.AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
<p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.

For the avoidance of doubt, Skillz's mission is to provide a training on Growth Hacking and mentoring support directly with our bot on Slack. This lesson has been written by an expert, and we cannot have any responsability on how you implement what you're gonna learn with our bot within your company, organization or as an individual.</p>



<h2>2.CHANGES TO TERMS OR SERVICES</h2>
<p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion, including by promulgating specific policies or 
guidelines for use of the Services, which will become part of these Terms. If we do so, we’ll let you know either 
by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications (including, as to Specific Policies, by reference 
in the documentation describing the proper use of the Services). It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify 
them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that 
you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the 
Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, 
at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.



<h2>3. WHO MAY USE THE SERVICES</h2>
<p>Eligibility. You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with 
Intelligence+ and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. You agree that you won’t disclose your 
Account password to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible 
for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p>



<h2>4. PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy (www.skillz.io/privacy) for information on how we collect, use and disclose 
information from our users.</p>



<h2>5. CONTENT AND CONTENT RIGHTS</h2>

authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made

(such as responses) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Services.
 We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.</p>



<h2>7. PAYMENT AND FEES</h2>
<p>The price of the Services will be as quoted on our Site and may change from time to time. Product prices include VAT. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.

Product prices are likely to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch Confirmation.

We accept payment by credit card, debit card for all orders. Our payment is managed by the Stripe solution. 

We will not charge your credit or debit card account until we dispatch your order. When you enter your personal and financial information online that information is encrypted by the service Stripe which encrypts all information prior to transmitting it over the Internet. 

Your payment to the Services is a one-off payment and is not a subscription period. You will not be charged again once you've made your one-off payment on that content. 

</p>



<h2>8. OUR REFUNDS POLICY</h2>
<p>Your legal right to cancel a contract under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulation 2000 does not apply to sale of a training, and online content. If you're not happy with the training that you bought, we cannot offer a refund. </p>



<h2>9. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES OR RESOURCES</h2>

third-party websites or resources.</p>

survive will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, 
and dispute resolution provisions.</p>

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL INTELLIGENCE+’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

<h2>14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<p>Governing Law. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Paris, France without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. General Terms

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Intelligence+ and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between INTELLIGENCE+ and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Intelligence+’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Intelligence+ may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. Any notices or other communications provided by Intelligence+ under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

INTELLIGENCE+’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a 
waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only 
if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Intelligence+. Except as expressly set 
forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice 
to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
